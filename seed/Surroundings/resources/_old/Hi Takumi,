Hi Takumi,

Thanks for the advice on the connection!
Unfortunately, no blinking light on the SDMMC yet.

A few follow-up questions;

1. You mentioned to connect DO to D0, which is marked 'USB ID' on the daisy pinout. Shouldn't this be D4, which would be DATA0?
2. Is there a diagram on how to connect the ST-LINK V2 to the daisy seed headers? I happen to have that debugger already. If the V3 is necessary, please let me know.
3. I formatted a 128GB SanDisk Extreme SD card to FAT with MBR, and put a 48kHz 16bit mono WAV file on it. Would this be fine for testing the WavPlayer? I can't seem to find any precise specs on what SD card to use.
4. As you can see I attempted to wire the SD card socket as direct as possible using the breadboard, as I read about the sensitivity of the interface. Would this be a viable test setup, or would I need to create a PCB in order to start testing?
5. Would I need to configure the SD card reader setting to SLOW when breadboarding, as suggested in the earlier thread you mentioned?

That's a lot of questions, but I can't seem to find a complete guide on how to properly connect an SD card to the daisy. Is there a resource I'm missing? Otherwise, I could share an overview of all I had to do to get it working with specs and diagrams, that might be nice to include in the wiki (if you're up for that).

Thanks for the amazing support. Really nice to be able to put up questions here on the Discord channel.
